# HubbleParamsPrediction
To analyze the universe's accelerated expansion by fitting a cosmological model to observational Hubble parameter data at various redshifts. The goal is to constrain the current density parameters of matter ( Ω 𝑚  ), curvature ( Ω 𝑘 ), and dark energy ( Ω Λ ), plot their marginalized probability distributions, and report uncertainties.
